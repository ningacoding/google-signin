# Installation

There are two ways to consume the package: The latest version of the package which

✅ is documented on this website

✅ supports the new One Tap sign-in on [Android](https://developers.google.com/identity/one-tap/android/overview) and [Web](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/features), fully compatible (same API) with iOS

✅ supports the [React Native New Architecture](https://reactnative.dev/docs/new-architecture-intro)

✅ includes various API improvements (synchronous methods and more) and fixes

is only available to [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/vonovak) of the maintainer.

When you become a sponsor using one of the marked tiers, you will automatically[*](#invitation-note) be invited to a private repo with the latest version of the package.

Thank you for supporting continued maintenance and development of this module! ❤️

Alternatively, you can install from the public registry which will install an older version.

## Accessing the new package for sponsors

Three steps are needed to access the sponsored package, which is hosted on [GitHub npm packages registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry).

1. [Become a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/vonovak) - it takes just a few clicks.

2. [Obtain here](https://github.com/settings/tokens) a Personal Access Token with `packages:read` permission.

3. Set up your package manager so that it fetches the package from the GH packages registry. In this example, we're using an `NPM_TOKEN_GOOGLE_SIGN_IN` environment variable.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="yarn v3" label="yarn v3">
    create a `.yarnrc.yml` file in your project root with the following content:

```yml
npmScopes:
  react-native-google-signin:
    npmRegistryServer: https://npm.pkg.github.com
    npmAuthToken: '${NPM_TOKEN_GOOGLE_SIGN_IN}'
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="classic" label="npm / yarn v1">
    create a `.npmrc` file in your project root with the following content:

```
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN_GOOGLE_SIGN_IN}

@react-native-google-signin:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

If you use another package manager ([such as bun](https://bun.sh/docs/install/registries)), please refer to its documentation on how to set up a custom registry.

## Requirements

The package requires React Native 0.60 or higher.

If you're using the [New Architecture](https://reactnative.dev/docs/new-architecture-intro), you need to be on React Native 0.72 or higher.

## Installing

```bash
yarn add @react-native-google-signin/google-signin
```

There are several guides to follow now:

- [Expo guide](setting-up/expo) for native mobile apps built with Expo
- [Web guide](setting-up/web) if you want to use the package on the Web
- If you're not using Expo but plain React Native, follow [Android guide](setting-up/android) and [iOS guide](setting-up/ios)

##### Invitation Note

As a sponsor, you will be added automatically if you sponsor from a personal account. If you sponsor from an organization account, please let me know and I'll add you manually. This is because of a [GitHub's limitation](https://docs.github.com/en/sponsors/receiving-sponsorships-through-github-sponsors/managing-your-sponsorship-tiers#about-adding-repositories-to-a-sponsorship-tier).
